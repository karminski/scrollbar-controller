# Backup Directory

This directory contains backup copies of files from the original single-file userscript before the modular refactoring.

## Files

- `original-scrollbar-control.user.js` - The original single-file userscript before refactoring

## Purpose

These files are kept for reference purposes during and after the refactoring process. They help ensure that no functionality is lost during the transition to the modular architecture.

## Note

The active, maintained version of the project is now built from the `src/` directory and output to the `dist/` directory. These backup files should not be used in production.
